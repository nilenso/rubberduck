I don\\'t know how to bring it up to my parents, and that makes me miserable.\\n\\n Response: You are not alone, many people fear opening up to family members about the topic of depression or mental illness. There are many different reason why some may fear telling their parents. The most common thoughts I hear in my office are: \" My parents won\\'t understand me\", I may cause more problems to the family\", \"I am worried that something bad may happen if I tell them\".\\xa0If possible express your current concerns and worries to your parents. You can start the conversation with your parents by saying \"I have not been feeling like myself lately, and I may want to see a counselor\".\\xa0I think you are doing the right thing by going on this website and asking for help. Just a helpful tip: positive self-talk can be beneficial before having difficult conversations with others. For example, tell yourself something positive before talking to your parents such as \"I feel confident in myself, and I am doing this to overcome my fear of talking to my parents\" can help to decrease the anxiety you are feeling leading up to the conversation.\\xa0I would recommend if you are feeling depressed or down it would be beneficial to seek counseling to understand your current thoughts and behaviors. Best of luck and hope you decide to start counseling.'] ground_truth=\"Some common thoughts I hear in my office are: 'My parents won't understand me', I may cause more problems to the family', 'I am worried that something bad may happen if I tell them'.\" evolution_type='simple' metadata=[{}]\n"
